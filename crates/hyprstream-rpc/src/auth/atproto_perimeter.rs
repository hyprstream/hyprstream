//! ATProto perimeter gateway — external-DID → assurance binding (#549, first half).
//!
//! This is the **enrollment-time** translation seam between a federated ATProto
//! identity (an external `Did`) and the internal MAC lattice (#548). It "translates,
//! does not tunnel": an external DID is resolved **once, off the auth path**, its
//! verified key material is mapped to an [`Assurance`], and the result is pinned as
//! an [`EnrolledPeer`] carrying a derived [`SecurityContext`]. The per-op reference
//! monitor (#548 S2) then reads the *cached* context and never re-resolves.
//!
//! ## What this module is / is not
//!
//! - **Is:** the `external Did → VerifiedKeyMaterial → SecurityContext` mapping plus
//!   a mutable, admission-gated [`EnrollmentStore`]. It consumes the (mirrored)
//!   #579 resolver and the *existing* epic MAC types ([`Assurance`],
//!   [`SecurityLabel`], [`SecurityContext`], [`VerifiedKeyMaterial`]) — it does
//!   **not** re-declare any of them.
//! - **Is not:** per-op enforcement (#548 S2), the OAuth-scope/lexicon → UCAN+MAC
//!   half (split follow-up), or a concrete `did:plc`/`did:web` resolver (#579).
//!
//! ## Fail-closed
//!
//! Any resolver error, a `None` DID, or a missing verifying key yields `Err` ⇒ the
//! peer is **not** enrolled. There is no default enrollment and no default
//! assurance: an un-resolvable identity dominates nothing above the lattice floor.
//!
//! ## Zero standing privilege (ZSP)
//!
//! The enrollment edge ceiling is `Level::Internal × <crypto-derived assurance> ×
//! EMPTY` compartments. Compartments are **explicit grants made later**, never
//! conferred at enrollment. The clamp-down in
//! [`SecurityContext::from_clearance`] guarantees a classical peer can never obtain
//! a `PqHybrid` context even if the ceiling allowed it.

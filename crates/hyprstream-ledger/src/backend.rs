//! The `LedgerBackend` trait — the load-bearing accounting-plane surface every
//! backend (MemLedger now; RocksLedger, TigerBeetleLedger later) implements, and
//! the enforcer builds on (plan §3.2).
//!
//! PLAN DECISION 8: the trait is **synchronous and blocking**. Every backend is
//! single-writer anyway (plan §2a), so the service layer owns the actor thread
//! and exposes the async facade (`LedgerHandle::submit → oneshot`). Keeping the
//! core sync is what keeps it tokio-free (the WASM requirement), matches
//! RocksDB's sync API, and confines TigerBeetle's async client inside its feature
//! gate.

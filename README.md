- **Write-Through to ADBC Datastores**: Ensures eventual data consistency with immediate caching and write-through to backend datastores such as Postgres, Redis, and Snowflake via ADBC.

### 🧠 Intelligent Read Caching with DuckDB

- **In-Memory Performance**: Uses **DuckDB** for lightning-fast caching of frequently accessed data.
- **Optimized Querying**: Stores query results and intermediate computations for analytics workloads.
- **Automatic Management**: Handles caching transparently, reducing manual effort.
- **Expiry Policies**:
  - **Time-Based**: Automatically expires data after a configurable duration.
  - **LRU/LFU (Work in Progress)**: Future enhancements for intelligent cache eviction.

### 🌐 Data Serving with Arrow Flight SQL

- **High-Performance Queries**: Serves cached data via **Arrow Flight SQL** for minimal latency.
- **Supports Advanced Workflows**:
  - Vectorized data for AI/ML pipelines.
  - Analytical queries for real-time insights.
- **Downstream Integration**: Connects seamlessly with analytics and visualization tools.

### ⚡ Real-Time Aggregation
- **Dynamic Metrics**: Maintains running sums, counts, and averages for real-time insights.
- **Lightweight State Management**: Avoids storing the full dataset by maintaining only aggregate states.
- **Dynamic Weight Computation**: Enables the calculation of weights and biases in real time for AI/ML pipelines.
- **Instant Feedback**: Provides immediate access to derived metrics for analytics and inference.
- **Time Window Partitioning**: Supports partitioning aggregate calculations into fixed time windows for granular analysis.

## Application Workflow 🔧

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion

1. Data producers send data to Hyprstream via the **Arrow Flight ingestion API**.
2. The data is processed and stored in the in-memory **DuckDB cache**.
3. Aggregates for sums, counts, and averages are dynamically updated as new data arrives.
4. Aggregate calculations can be partitioned into **time windows** (e.g., 5m, 30m, hourly, daily, weekly) for advanced insights.

### 2️⃣ Query Processing

1. Consumers send queries via **Arrow Flight SQL**.
2. Hyprstream handles queries intelligently:
   - **Cache Hit**: Data is retrieved directly from the **DuckDB cache**.
   - **Cache Miss**: Queries are routed to ADBC-compliant backend datastores, ensuring reliable data access.
3. Results from cache misses are written back to the cache for future requests.
4. Pre-computed aggregates (e.g., averages, running totals) are served for metrics queries, minimizing processing latency.
5. Queries can retrieve **aggregates by time window** for granular metrics (e.g., sales by hour, user activity by day).

### 3️⃣ Cache Expiry

- **Periodic Evaluation**: Evaluates cached data regularly to maintain optimal resource utilization.
- **Automatic Eviction**: Frees up memory by expiring outdated or unused entries.
- **Window Expiry**: Removes data for expired time windows to conserve resources while retaining recent insights.

## Benefits 🌟

- **🚀 Blazing Fast**: Achieve ultra-low latency with in-memory caching and efficient query routing.
- **⚙️ Scalable**: Handles large-scale data workflows with ease.
- **🔗 Flexible**: Integrates seamlessly with multiple backend systems like Postgres, Redis, and Snowflake.
- **🤖 AI/ML Ready**: Designed to support vectorized data for AI/ML inference pipelines.
- **📈 Real-Time Metrics**: Dynamically calculate and serve statistical metrics (e.g., averages) for monitoring and inference.
- **⌛ Time-Partitioned Insights**: Gain granular control of metrics with support for fixed time windows.
- **⛭ Rust-Powered**: Built using the high-performance, memory-safe Rust programming language, ensuring reliability and speed.

## Comparisons 🆚

Hyprstream is designed to complement and, in some cases, simplify workflows compared to heavier stream processing tools like Apache Flink and integrate into existing workflows. Below is a summary of how Hyprstream compares:

| **Feature**             | **Hyprstream**                           | **Apache Flink**                           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Direct Querying**     | ✅ Native via Arrow Flight SQL            | ❌ Requires external sinks like Kafka or DB |
| **Focus**               | Real-time aggregation, caching, querying | General-purpose stream processing          |
| **Integration**         | Microservices-friendly                   | Requires external storage for query access |
| **Complexity**          | Low                                      | High (cluster, jobs, state management)     |
| **Latency**             | Ultra-low (direct in-memory querying)    | Higher (data must be written to sinks)     |
| **Aggregation Support** | Fixed-time windowing, simple metrics     | Advanced, customizable windowing           |
| **Best for**            | Lightweight metrics and analytics        | Complex event-driven architectures         |

Hyprstream offers lightweight, low-latency solutions for teams that prioritize simplicity and integration into microservices, and accelerates workflows built on Apache Arrow. By contrast, Flink excels in handling large-scale, complex event processing workflows, making it an excellent choice for teams with advanced stream processing needs and less latency-critical workflows. Hyprstream and Flink can work together to deliver a comprehensive solution, combining real-time aggregation and caching with powerful stream processing capabilities.

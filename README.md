# Hyprstream: Real-time Aggregation Windows and High-Performance Cache for Apache Arrow Flight SQL 🚀

[![Rust](https://github.com/hyprstream/hyprstream/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hyprstream/hyprstream/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

📄 **[Read our DRAFT Technical Paper: Hyprstream: A Unified Architecture for Multimodal Data Processing and Real-Time Foundational Model Inference](HYPRSTREAM_PAPER_DRAFT.md)**

⚠️ **PRE-RELEASE: This is a work in progress alpha and is not yet ready for production and is in early stages of development** ⚠️ ️

🌟 Hyprstream is a next-generation application for real-time data ingestion, windowed aggregation, caching, and serving. Built on Apache Arrow Flight and DuckDB, and developed in Rust, Hyprstream dynamically calculates metrics like running sums, counts, and averages, enabling blazing-fast data workflows, intelligent caching, and seamless integration with ADBC-compliant datastores. Its real-time aggregation capabilities empower AI/ML pipelines and analytics with instant insights. 💾✨

🚧 **This product is in preview during rapid early development**. While we're laying the groundwork for advertised capabilities, there are known bugs 🐛, partially implemented features 🔨, and frequent updates ahead 🔄. Your feedback and collaboration will be invaluable in shaping the project's direction 🌱.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. 📥 Install Hyprstream:
   ```bash
   cargo install hyprstream
   ```

2. 🏃 Start the server with default configuration:
   ```bash
   hyprstream
   ```

3. 🔌 Use with PostgreSQL backend (requires PostgreSQL ADBC driver):
   ```bash
   # Set backend-specific credentials securely via environment variables
   export HYPRSTREAM_ENGINE_USERNAME=postgres
   export HYPRSTREAM_ENGINE_PASSWORD=secret

   # Start Hyprstream with connection details (but without credentials)
   hyprstream \
     --engine adbc \
     --engine-connection "postgresql://localhost:5432/metrics?pool_max=10&pool_min=1&connect_timeout=30" \
     --engine-options driver_path=/usr/local/lib/libadbc_driver_postgresql.so \
     --enable-cache \
     --cache-engine duckdb \
     --cache-connection ":memory:"
   ```

For configuration options and detailed documentation, run:
```bash
hyprstream --help
```

## 💡 Example Usage

### 🚀 Quick Start with ADBC

Hyprstream implements the Arrow Flight SQL protocol, making it compatible with any ADBC-compliant client:

```python
import adbc_driver_flightsql.dbapi

# Connect to Hyprstream using standard ADBC
conn = adbc_driver_flightsql.dbapi.connect("grpc://localhost:50051")

try:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Query metrics with time windows
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT 
            metric_id,
            COUNT(*) as samples,
            AVG(value_running_window_avg) as avg_value
        FROM metrics
        WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
        GROUP BY metric_id
        ORDER BY avg_value DESC
    """)
    
    results = cursor.fetch_arrow_table()
    print(results.to_pandas())
    
finally:
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
```

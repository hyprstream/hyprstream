# Hyprstream Mission

## Vision
**Eliminate the boundary between training and inference through temporal adaptation and 99% sparse neural networks.**

## Core Innovation: Temporal LoRA with VDB Storage

### Traditional Approach
```
Static Model → Inference → Static Output
```

### Hyprstream Approach
```
Dynamic Model → Inference + Learning → Evolving Output

  Sparse    Real-time Updates    Continuous Adaptation
```

## Key Principles

### 1. VDB-First Architecture
- Neural networks stored as sparse tensors in OpenVDB format
- Hierarchical storage

### 2. Temporal Weight Updates
- Models adapt DURING inference, not after
- Streaming weight updates in real-time
- No separation between "training mode" and "inference mode"

### 3. Continuous Learning
- Every interaction improves the model
- User feedback directly updates weights
- Models evolve with their usage patterns

### 4. Ultra-Efficient Storage
- NeuralVDB compression 
- Sparse LoRA adapters
- Hardware-accelerated VDB operations

## Technical Goals

1. **Inference that learns** - Models improve while generating
2. **Training that's instant** - No separate fine-tuning phase
3. **Memory that's minimal** - Sparse storage as default
4. **Adaptation that's automatic** - Models self-optimize for tasks

## Why This Matters

Current ML systems treat training and inference as separate phases. Hyprstream makes them one continuous process:

- **For Users**: Models that understand you better with each interaction
- **For Developers**: No need to retrain - models adapt automatically
- **For Infrastructure**: Less memory with better performance
- **For AI Safety**: Transparent, traceable weight updates

## The Future

Hyprstream represents a fundamental shift in how we think about neural networks - from static artifacts to living, adapting systems that learn continuously from every interaction.
